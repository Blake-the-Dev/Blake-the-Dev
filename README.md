Hi, I'm Blake!

I am a university student at Deakin University and have just entered my 4th year of a Bachelor of Information Technology.

Web development has interested me for a long time and I have decided to add the work I have done here so that I can show others what I am capable of.

I primarily focus on Back End development but am more than able to complete the Full Stack.
